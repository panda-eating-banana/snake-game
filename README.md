Snake Game

Overview:
The Snake Game is a classic game implemented using Python and the Pygame library. 
The objective is to control a snake that grows longer as it eats food, 
while avoiding poison blocks that appear randomly. The game ends if the snake collides with itself or a poison block.

Features:
- Snake Movement: Control the snake using arrow keys.
- Food: The snake grows when it eats food.
- Poison Blocks: Randomly appearing poison blocks that the snake must avoid.
- Speed Increase: The snake's speed increases as it consumes food.
- Wrap-Around Logic: The snake can wrap around the screen when it goes off the edges.
- Game Over and Restart: The game ends when the snake collides with itself or a poison block. You can restart or quit after a game-over screen.

Requirements:
- Python 3.x
- Pygame Library

Installation:

1. Install Python:
   Ensure you have Python 3.x installed on your system. You can download it from the official website: https://www.python.org/downloads/

2. Install Pygame:
   To install the Pygame library, run the following command in your terminal or command prompt:

   pip3 install pygame

How to Run the Game:

1. Open the folder containing the game script (snake_game.py).
2. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the folder where the game script is located.
3. Run the game by executing the following command:

   python snake_game.py

This will open a window where you can start playing the game.

Game Controls:
- Arrow Keys: Use the arrow keys (Up, Down, Left, Right) to control the snake's movement.
- R: Press R to restart the game after a game over.
- Q: Press Q to quit the game after a game over.

Game Objective:
- Eat food to grow the snake and increase your score.
- Avoid poison blocks that appear randomly on the screen. If you hit a poison block or your own body, the game ends.
- Grow the snake and increase its speed as you eat more food.

Additional Information:
- The snakeâ€™s speed increases each time it eats food, making the game more challenging as it progresses.
- Poison blocks spawn randomly and expire after a certain time, adding an additional challenge to the game.
